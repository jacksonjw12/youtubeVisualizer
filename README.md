# youtubeVisualizer
A visualizer enhancer for rainmeter which can display youtube video names.
Tired of your rainmeter visualizer not displaying the name of the song playing in youtube on your chrome browser?
Through the power of a chrome extension, and chromes local storage, this will soon be possible.
This chrome extension will pick the video title of the your current tab with youtube playing, and will store that, along with some other info, in a file accessible by a rainmeter skin.
